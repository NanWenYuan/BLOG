# 《Sonnet_130》

`William Shakespeare`

---

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun  
我的爱人的眼睛一点不像太阳  
Coral is far more red than her lips' red:  
珊瑚比她的嘴唇还要红得多  
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;  
雪若算白，她的胸脯就暗褐无光  
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.  
发若是铁丝，她头上铁丝婆娑  
i have seen roses damask'd, red and white,  
我见过红白的玫瑰，轻纱一般  
but no such roses see i in her cheeks;  
她颊上却找不到这样的玫瑰  
and in some perfumes is there more delight  
有许多芳香非常逗引人喜欢  
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.  
我的爱人的呼吸并没有这香味  
i love to hear her speak, yet well i know  
我爱听她谈话，可是我很清楚  
that music hath a far more pleasing sound:  
音乐的悦耳远胜于她的嗓子  
i grant i never saw a goddess go,  
我承认从没有见过女神走路  
my mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:  
我的爱人走路时候却脚踏实地  
and yet, by heaven, i think my love is rare  
可是，我敢指天发誓，我的爱侣   
as any she belied with false compare.  
胜似任何被捧作天仙的美女
