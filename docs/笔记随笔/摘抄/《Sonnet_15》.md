# 《Sonnet_15》

`William Shakespeare`

---

When I consider everything that grows  
当我看到一切生长之物  
Holds in perfection but a little moment  
只在刹那间能够完美  
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows  
世界舞台上一无所有  
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment  
唯有星辰在秘密中牵引  
When I perceive that men as plants increase  
我看到人类像草木一样生长  
Cheer’d and check’deven by the self-same sky  
被同样的天空赋予盛衰  
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease  
少时繁茂，日中则仄  
And wear their brave state out of memory  
一切美好都从记忆中被抹去  
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay  
于是这瞬间停留的诡计  
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight  
让你青春的盛容出现在我面前  
Where wasteful time debateth with decay  
而残暴的时间和腐朽商议  
To change your day of youth to sullied night  
要把你青春的白日变成暗淡黑夜  
And all in war with time for love of you  
为了爱你 我将和时间对抗  
As he takes from you, l engraft you new.  
当他从你身上夺走时，我会为你重新嫁接。
