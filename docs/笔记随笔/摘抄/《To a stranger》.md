# 《To a stranger》

`Walt Whitman`

Passing stranger  
擦肩而过的陌生人  
you do not know how longingly I look upon you  
你有所不知 我多么热切的注视着你  
You must be he I was seeking  
你一定是我苦苦寻觅的那个他  
Or she I was seeking  
亦或是那个她  
It comes to me, as a dream  
这对我而言宛若梦境  
I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you  
我与你必定曾在某处 共度充满喜悦的一生  
All is recall'd as we flit by each other  
我们擦肩而过时一切又重现了  
Fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured  
一切自由的 亲昵的 忠贞的 成熟的  
You grew up with me  
我们相伴长大  
Were a boy with me or a girl with me  
你是我身边的那个小男孩或是小女孩  
I ate with you and slept with you  
我们同吃同住  
Your body has become not yours only  
你的躯体早已不仅仅属于你  
Nor left my body mine only  
我的躯体也不单单属于我  
You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass  
你赐予我快乐，用你的双眸，容颜和肉体  
You take of my beard, breast, hands, in return  
我回报以快乐，用我的胡须，胸膛和双手  
I am not to speak to you  
我不会与你交谈   
I am to think of you  
我只会思念你  
When I sit alone or wake at night alone  
每当我孑然独坐或午夜梦回  
I am to wait

I do not doubt I am to meet you again  
我毫不怀疑我们还会重逢  
I am to see to it that I do not lose you  
我决计不会再失去你
